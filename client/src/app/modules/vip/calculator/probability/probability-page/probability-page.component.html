            In independent probability, the probability of each event occurring is not affected by the outcomes of previous events. 
            Each event is considered to be unrelated to the others in terms of probability. 
            This is in contrast to "Dependent Probability" where the outcome of one event can influence the probability of subsequent events.

        <p class="text-justify text-base font-medium mt-10">In these examples, the key idea is that the outcome of one event is not influenced by the outcomes of previous events, making them independent probabilities.</p>
